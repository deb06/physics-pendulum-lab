= Abstract
A pendulum is a weight suspended from a fixed point that swings back and forth due to the force of gravity. The agreed upon value for standard gravity is 9.80665$m$/$s^2$. If you are able to correctly measure the length of one period in a pendulum swing and the length of the string, you should be able to derive the standard gravity value.
